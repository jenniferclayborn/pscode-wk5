// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if num1=odd
print odd else print even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered 
numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message 
describing what they are

step a
  numbers = array of 5

step b
   = sum of all nums
   average = sum/5

step c

for nums 1 to 5
min=num1 (makes first number min)
if nums[i] < min then min = num[i]
update min if current number is smaller

max=num1 (makes first number max)
if nums[i] > max then max = number[i] update max if current number is 
larger

step d
 
print "average =" + average
print "smallest number =" + min
print "largest number =" + max
